# Neural Network Quantum State (NNQS)

The project aim to treat neural network as an tensor approximation tool by training the neural network with one regression output, i.e. the tensor value.

The original motivation is to study the obtain the ground state of quantum many body problems, where the ground state is a high dimensional tensor.
